To download, configure, and install Linux kernel version 6.8 on your Ubuntu system without using menuconfig, and to disable certificate verification during the build process, follow these steps:

1. Install Necessary Dependencies:

Ensure your system has the required packages for building the kernel:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential libncurses-dev bison flex libssl-dev libelf-dev
2. Download the Kernel Source:

Obtain the Linux kernel 6.8 source code from the official Linux Kernel Archives:

bash
Copy code
cd /usr/src
sudo wget https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v6.x/linux-6.8.tar.xz
3. Extract the Source Code:

Unpack the downloaded tarball:

bash
Copy code
sudo tar -xf linux-6.8.tar.xz
cd linux-6.8
4. Configure the Kernel Without menuconfig:

If menuconfig is unavailable, you can use make defconfig to create a default configuration file:

bash
Copy code
make defconfig
This command generates a default .config file based on your system's architecture.

5. Disable Certificate Verification:

To disable certificate verification, edit the .config file directly:

	sed -i 's/CONFIG_MODULE_SIG=y/CONFIG_MODULE_SIG=n/' .config
	scripts/config --set-str SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYS ""
	scripts/config --set-str SYSTEM_REVOCATION_KEYS ""

This command changes the CONFIG_MODULE_SIG setting to 'n', disabling module signature verification.

6. Compile the Kernel:

Build the kernel and its modules:

	make -j$(nproc)
	The -j$(nproc) flag utilizes all available CPU cores to speed up the compilation.

7. Install Modules:

After a successful compilation, install the kernel modules:

	sudo make modules_install

8. Install the Kernel:

Install the compiled kernel:

	sudo make install

9. Update Bootloader:

Ensure that the bootloader is updated to recognize the new kernel:

	sudo update-grub

10. Reboot into the New Kernel:

Reboot your system to start using the new kernel:

	sudo reboot
11. Verify the New Kernel:

After rebooting, confirm that your system is running the new kernel:

	uname -r
This command should display 6.8.0, indicating that the new kernel is active.

Note: Building and installing a custom kernel can affect system stability and compatibility. It's recommended to test the new kernel thoroughly and keep a backup of your current working kernel to revert if necessary.
